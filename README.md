# sorting-algorithms
The purpose of this sorting algorithms is for me to be able to demonstrate my knowledge on sorting algorithm concepts while also re-establishing the basic fundamentals of sorting algorithms.

## Bubble Sorting

## Insertion Sort

## Quick Sort

## Selection Sort

To be able to do selection sorting, we have keep track of a minimum index which will be the starting value of the array(this value will switch as we move one), when we find a value smaller than the value in the minimum value then we declare that value to the position that we found a smaller value once that is done, we then swap the positions of the current value we are located at to the smallest value we found.
